## Foundation Building

### 1. Assessment of Current Skills
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and other relevant topics.

### 2. Basic Concepts
- Review fundamental concepts of programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++), including syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and classes.

### 3. Data Structures
- Study basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- Understand their implementation, operations, and time complexity.

### 4. Algorithms
- Learn essential algorithms like searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.
- Practice algorithmic problem-solving techniques on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
